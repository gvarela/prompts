## Context Package Structure (Step 3)

Build exactly this structure from the documentation you've read — only what workers actually need:

```javascript
const contextPackage = {
  // From research.md - patterns workers must follow
  patterns: {
    testingFramework: "jest | pytest | go test | ...",
    testFileLocation: "tests/ | __tests__ | *_test.go | ...",
    fileStructure: "src/ layout | pkg/ layout | ...",
    namingConventions: "camelCase | snake_case | ...",
    importPatterns: "how modules are imported",
    errorHandling: "established patterns"
  },

  // From design.md - relevant to this phase
  design: {
    phaseGoal: "what this phase achieves",
    successCriteria: ["criterion 1", "criterion 2"],
    constraints: ["constraint 1", "constraint 2"],
    architecturalApproach: "key decisions"
  },

  // From tasks.md frontmatter
  beads: {
    epicId: "beads-xxx",
    phaseMilestoneId: "beads-yyy",
    mode: "$BEADS_MODE"
  },

  // Test commands
  testCommands: {
    unit: "npm test | pytest | go test ./...",
    specific: "npm test path/to/file | pytest tests/file.py",
    coverage: "npm test -- --coverage | pytest --cov"
  },

  // File references relevant to this phase
  relevantFiles: [
    "src/feature/file1.ts:123 - existing pattern to follow",
    "tests/feature/test1.spec.ts:45 - test structure example"
  ]
};
```

## Worker Model Selection (Step 5)

Retired: the `determineModel()` keyword-regex spec was replaced by coordinator judgment (2026-06, prompts-0my) — the coordinator reads the task content and picks haiku (mechanical config/docs/renames), sonnet (standard implementation), or opus (bugs/refactors/architecture; default when unsure), passing the choice as a per-spawn model override on the `task-worker` agent.

## Worker Failure Playbook (Step 6)

If a worker leaves its task in `in_progress` (didn't close the beads issue), the worker crashed or couldn't complete. Verification is NOT run when the worker didn't finish — that path is for verification FAILs after successful completion.

Present:

```
⚠️ Worker Did Not Complete Task

Task ${taskId} status: in_progress (should be closed)
Worker reported: ${workerError}

This means the worker crashed or couldn't complete the task.
Verification agent is NOT run if worker didn't finish.

**Options**:
1. Retry worker with same context
2. Retry worker with additional context
3. Mark task as blocked, investigate
4. Manual intervention required

How should I proceed?
```

## Plan-Defect Deviation Protocol (Step 6)

For verification FAILs where the task cannot succeed AS SPECIFIED — the design assumption doesn't survive contact with the code. Retrying burns fix workers on a task that is wrong by construction; deviate instead.

**Signals it's a plan defect, not an implementation defect**:

- The verifier cites a requirement the codebase cannot satisfy (missing interface, contradicted constraint, false precondition)
- The worker followed the spec exactly and tests still fail on the specified behavior
- The fix would change design.md, not code

**Protocol**:

1. **File the defect**:

   ```bash
   bd create --title="Design revision: [assumption that failed]" \
     --description="Task [task-id] cannot succeed as specified: [verifier evidence]. Affected design section: [design.md reference]" \
     --type=task --priority=1
   ```

2. **Block dependents**: `bd dep add [dependent-task-id] [revision-issue-id]` for every not-yet-run task that builds on the failed assumption

3. **Halt the phase**: stop spawning workers; present a checkpoint to the user with the failed task, the verifier evidence, and the revision issue ID

4. **Route the fix**: the revision goes through `/wb:create_design` (preceded by `/wb:explore_design` if it reopens an architectural choice) — never through fix workers
