**Reason**: [handoff reason]
**Current Phase**: Phase [N] of [Total]
**Overall Progress**: [X]% complete

## Quick Start

To resume this work:
```bash
# Resume with this handoff
/resume_handoff [this file path]

# Or manually:
1. Read this handoff document
2. Read tasks.md to see current phase
3. Check git status for uncommitted changes
4. Continue from "Next Steps" section below
```

## Current State Summary

## Critical Learnings

### Discoveries Not in Documentation

1. **Pattern Discovery**: The codebase uses [pattern] at `file:line` which isn't documented. Must follow this for consistency.

2. **Hidden Dependency**: `ComponentX` depends on `ServiceY` being initialized first. Not obvious from code structure.

3. **Performance Gotcha**: Method at `file:line` is called frequently - optimization critical here.

4. **Workaround Required**: Standard approach doesn't work because [reason]. Using [workaround] instead.

```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Tasks

1. **Complete current task**: [Specific task from tasks.md]
   - Start at: `file:line`
   - Implement: [What to add/change]
   - Verify with: [Test command]

2. **Fix blocker**: [If any]

3. **Continue phase**: Complete remaining [N] tasks in Phase [M]

### Recommended Approach

```bash
# 1. Resume from handoff
/resume_handoff [this file]

# 2. Check git status
git status

# 3. Run tests to verify state
npm test

# 4. Continue with next task
# [Specific guidance for next task]
