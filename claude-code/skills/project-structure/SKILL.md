# Project Structure

## Document Separation

**research.md** - Facts only (internal codebase + external research)
- WHAT EXISTS: Current code, external patterns, options, capabilities
- NO decisions, NO rationale, NO implementation steps

**design.md** - Decisions + rationale only
- WHAT to build, WHY chosen
- Architectural decisions, trade-offs, scope
- NO facts without decisions, NO implementation steps

**tasks.md** - Implementation only
- HOW to implement: specific steps, file changes, tests
- NO rationale, NO alternatives

**thoughts/** - Explorations & refinements
- Questions, experiments, discussions
- Understanding refinements before decisions
- Informal notes, brainstorming
- Anything not ready for formal docs

## Quick Check

- Decision? → design.md
- Fact/Option? → research.md
- Step/Code? → tasks.md
- Exploring/Unsure? → thoughts/
