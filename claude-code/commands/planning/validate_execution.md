# Validate Execution

Validates that an execution plan was correctly implemented, verifying all success criteria and identifying any deviations, gaps, or issues.

## Purpose

This command provides an objective assessment of implementation completeness by:
- Verifying claimed completions match actual code changes
- Running all automated verification checks
- Identifying deviations from the plan
- Documenting gaps or issues found
- Providing clear manual testing requirements

Run this AFTER implementation to ensure quality before merging or deployment.

## Initial Response

When invoked, check for arguments:

1. **If directory provided** (e.g., `/validate_execution docs/plans/2025-01-08-my-project/`):
   - Use `$1` as the project directory
   - Read all documentation immediately
   - Begin validation process

2. **If no arguments**:
   ```
   I'll validate the execution of your implementation plan. Please provide:
   1. Path to the project documentation directory (e.g., docs/plans/2025-01-08-my-project/)

   I'll verify that the implementation matches the plan and all success criteria are met.
   ```

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Context Discovery

**⛔⛔⛔ BARRIER 1: STOP! Read ALL documentation FULLY - research.md, design.md, tasks.md ⛔⛔⛔**

```javascript
const projectDir = $1 || /* prompt for it */;

// Read all project documentation
const researchFile = `${projectDir}/research.md`;
const designFile = `${projectDir}/design.md`;
const tasksFile = `${projectDir}/tasks.md`;
```

1. **Read tasks.md completely** to understand:
   - What phases were planned
   - Which tasks are marked complete ([x])
   - Success criteria for each phase
   - Modified files listed

2. **Read design.md** to understand:
   - Original design decisions
   - Success metrics defined
   - Scope boundaries

3. **Read research.md** to understand:
   - Original state of the codebase
   - Patterns that should be followed

**think deeply about what was supposed to be built vs what exists**

### Step 2: Spawn Validation Agents

**Use parallel agents to verify implementation comprehensively:**

```javascript
// Spawn validation agents concurrently
Task({
  description: "Verify code changes",
  prompt: `Analyze all code changes to verify they match the execution plan.

  From tasks.md, these files should be modified:
  [List files from tasks.md]

  Check:
  - Were all listed files actually modified?
  - Do modifications match specified changes?
  - Are there unexpected modifications?
  - Were any planned changes missed?

  Use git diff to compare changes if needed.
  Return detailed comparison of planned vs actual.`,
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "haiku"  // Quick file comparison task
})

Task({
  description: "Verify test coverage",
  prompt: `Verify that all tests specified in the plan were implemented.

  From tasks.md, these tests were required:
  [List test requirements]

  Check:
  - Do all specified tests exist?
  - Do they test the right scenarios?
  - Are there gaps in coverage?
  - Do all tests pass?

  Run test commands and analyze coverage.
  Return test status and coverage analysis.`,
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "sonnet"  // More complex analysis
})

Task({
  description: "Check for regressions",
  prompt: `Verify no existing functionality was broken.

  Run comprehensive checks:
  - All existing tests still pass
  - Build succeeds without warnings
  - No performance degradation
  - No breaking changes to APIs

  Return any potential regressions found.`,
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "haiku"  // Standard checks
})

Task({
  description: "Analyze patterns and quality",
  prompt: `Verify implementation follows established patterns.

  From research.md, these patterns should be followed:
  [List patterns from research]

  Check:
  - Does new code follow existing patterns?
  - Are conventions maintained?
  - Is error handling consistent?
  - Are there any anti-patterns?

  Document pattern compliance.`,
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "sonnet"  // Pattern analysis
})
```

**⛔⛔⛔ BARRIER 2: STOP! Wait for ALL validation agents to complete ⛔⛔⛔**

### Step 3: Run Automated Verification

For each phase in tasks.md, run ALL automated verification commands:

```bash
# Common verification commands (adapt based on project)
make check      # Linting and formatting
make test       # Unit tests
make integration # Integration tests
make build      # Build verification

# Project-specific commands from tasks.md
[Run any specific commands listed in success criteria]
```

Document the results:
- ✅ Pass: Command succeeded
- ❌ Fail: Command failed (include error)
- ⚠️ Partial: Some issues but not blocking

### Step 4: Analyze Implementation Completeness

**think deeply about gaps between plan and reality**

For each phase in tasks.md:

1. **Check task completion**:
   - Verify each [x] checked task was actually done
   - Look for evidence in code changes
   - Identify any incomplete work

2. **Verify success criteria**:
   - Were all automated criteria met?
   - Are manual criteria ready for testing?
   - Any criteria impossible to verify?

3. **Identify deviations**:
   - Changes made differently than planned
   - Additional changes not in plan
   - Planned changes not implemented

4. **Assess impact**:
   - Are deviations improvements or problems?
   - Do they affect the overall solution?
   - Should they be documented or reverted?

### Step 5: Generate Validation Report

Create a comprehensive validation report:

```markdown
# Validation Report: [Project Name]
Generated: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]

## Executive Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ PASSED | ⚠️ PASSED WITH ISSUES | ❌ FAILED

- Planned Phases: [X]

## Validation Completed

**Next Steps**:
1. Address any critical issues identified
2. Perform manual testing using checklist above
3. Get approval from reviewer
4. Deploy with confidence

**Validator Notes**:
[Any additional context or observations about the implementation]
```

### Step 6: Update Documentation

If validation passes with minor issues:
1. Update tasks.md to reflect actual completion status
2. Document any approved deviations
3. Note lessons learned for future projects

If validation fails:
1. Clearly mark which tasks need completion
2. Provide specific guidance for fixes
3. Re-run validation after fixes

## Important Guidelines

### Validation Philosophy

1. **Be Objective**: Assess what IS, not what SHOULD BE
2. **Be Thorough**: Check everything, assume nothing
3. **Be Constructive**: Identify issues with solutions
4. **Be Precise**: Use file:line references for all claims
5. **Be Practical**: Focus on what matters for deployment

### What Makes a PASS vs FAIL

**✅ PASS**:
- All critical functionality implemented
- All automated tests pass
- No blocking issues
- Ready for manual testing

**⚠️ PASS WITH ISSUES**:
- Core functionality works
- Some non-critical issues exist
- Can be deployed with known limitations
- Issues documented for future work

**❌ FAIL**:
- Critical functionality missing
- Tests failing
- Blocking issues present
- Not safe to deploy

### Common Validation Checks

Always verify:
- [ ] All phases marked complete actually are
- [ ] All checked tasks have corresponding code
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Build succeeds cleanly
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] Patterns are followed
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Relationship to Other Commands

Recommended workflow:
1. `/create_research` - Document current state
2. `/create_design` - Decide what to build
3. `/create_execution` - Plan how to build
4. `/implement_tasks` - Build it with TDD
5. **`/validate_execution`** - Verify it was built correctly ← YOU ARE HERE
6. `/create_handoff` - Document for next session (if needed)

## Synchronization Points

1. **⛔ BARRIER 1**: Read all documentation first
2. **⛔ BARRIER 2**: Wait for all validation agents
3. **⛔ BARRIER 3**: Complete all automated checks before report

## Configuration

This command performs comprehensive validation of implemented plans. It can be run by the implementer for self-check or by another person/agent for objective validation.

Best used:
- After implementation before merge
- When resuming work to verify state
- Before deployment to production
- For quality assurance checks
