# Create Handoff

Creates a comprehensive handoff document to transfer your work context to another agent or resume in a new session. Captures critical context, learnings, and next steps that aren't in the formal documentation.

## Purpose

Handoff documents preserve:
- Work in progress and current status
- Critical learnings and discoveries
- Context not captured in formal docs
- Exact state for seamless resumption
- Blockers and their solutions
- Next steps with specific guidance

## Initial Response

When invoked, check for arguments:

1. **If directory provided** (e.g., `/create_handoff docs/plans/2025-01-08-my-project/ "switching to opus for complex logic"`):
   - Use `$1` as project directory
   - Use `$2+` as handoff reason (optional)
   - Begin handoff creation

2. **If no arguments**:
   ```
   I'll create a handoff document for your current work. Please provide:
   1. Path to the project documentation directory (e.g., docs/plans/2025-01-08-my-project/)
   2. Reason for handoff (optional, e.g., "session ending", "need different model", "blocked on approval")

   I'll document the current state for seamless continuation.
   ```

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Gather Current State

**⛔⛔⛔ BARRIER 1: STOP! Read ALL project docs AND review conversation history ⛔⛔⛔**

```javascript
const projectDir = $1 || /* prompt for it */;
const handoffReason = $2 || "session transfer";

// Read all project documentation
const researchFile = `${projectDir}/research.md`;
const designFile = `${projectDir}/design.md`;
const tasksFile = `${projectDir}/tasks.md`;
```

1. **Read all project documentation** to understand:
   - Project goals and current status
   - What's been completed
   - What's in progress

2. **Review conversation history** to capture:
   - Recent changes made
   - Problems encountered and solutions
   - Decisions made during implementation
   - Any deviations from plan

3. **Check TodoWrite list** if active to see:
   - Current task status
   - What was attempted
   - What remains

4. **Check beads state** to capture:
   ```bash
   bd stats                        # Overall project progress
   bd list --status=in_progress    # Active work
   bd blocked                      # Any blocked phases
   bd ready                        # What's available next
   ```

**think deeply about what context would be lost if starting fresh**

### Step 2: Analyze Work State

Determine the current implementation state:

1. **Implementation Progress**:
   - Which phase are we in?
   - Which tasks are complete/in-progress/blocked?
   - Any partial implementations?

2. **Critical Discoveries**:
   - Unexpected patterns found
   - Gotchas encountered
   - Solutions to tricky problems
   - Performance considerations discovered

3. **Deviations and Decisions**:
   - Where we deviated from plan and why
   - Judgment calls made
   - Trade-offs accepted

4. **Current Blockers**:
   - What's preventing progress
   - What's been tried
   - Potential solutions identified

### Step 3: Sync Beads and Check Git State

```bash
# Sync beads state before handoff (important!)
bd sync

# Check git status for work in progress
git status

# Check for uncommitted changes
git diff

# Note any staged changes
git diff --staged
```

Document any uncommitted work and its purpose.

### Step 4: Create Handoff Document

Create handoff in the project directory:

````markdown
---
created: [YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+TZ]
type: handoff
project: [project-name]
phase: [current phase number]
handoff_reason: [reason]
last_task: [description of last task worked on]
git_commit: [current HEAD commit]
git_branch: [current branch]
repository: [repository name]
beads_epic: [epic-id if exists]
beads_in_progress: [phase-id if actively working]
---

# Handoff: [Project Name] - [Brief Status]

**Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ]
**Reason**: [handoff reason]
**Current Phase**: Phase [N] of [Total]
**Overall Progress**: [X]% complete

## Quick Start

To resume this work:
```bash
# Resume with this handoff
/resume_handoff [this file path]

# Or manually:
1. Read this handoff document
2. Read tasks.md to see current phase
3. Check git status for uncommitted changes
4. Continue from "Next Steps" section below
```

### Beads Tracking State
```bash
# bd stats output
[total] open, [n] in_progress, [m] closed, [b] blocked

# Active phases (in_progress)
[phase-id]: [description]

```

## Critical Learnings

### Discoveries Not in Documentation

1. **Pattern Discovery**: The codebase uses [pattern] at `file:line` which isn't documented. Must follow this for consistency.

2. **Hidden Dependency**: `ComponentX` depends on `ServiceY` being initialized first. Not obvious from code structure.

3. **Performance Gotcha**: Method at `file:line` is called frequently - optimization critical here.

## Important Guidelines

### What to Include

**ALWAYS Include**:
- Current phase and task status
- Recent code changes (file:line)
- Problems solved and how
- Active blockers and attempted solutions
- Critical discoveries about codebase
- Next immediate steps

**Include When Relevant**:
- Uncommitted changes and why
- Deviations from plan
- Performance considerations found
- Security issues discovered
- Architectural insights

**Don't Include**:
- Large code blocks (use file:line references)
- Obvious information from project docs
- Generic advice
- Completed and verified work from previous phases

### Handoff Quality

A good handoff should allow someone to:
1. Understand exactly where you left off
2. Know what problems you solved
3. Avoid repeating failed attempts
4. Continue without re-discovering context
5. Make the same decisions you made

### When to Create Handoffs

Create a handoff when:
- Session is ending with work incomplete
- Switching to different model for complex work
- Blocked and need different expertise
- Completed significant milestone
- Made important discoveries

## Relationship to Other Commands

Typical workflows:

**Mid-Implementation Handoff**:
1. `/implement_tasks` - Working on implementation
2. [Hit blocker or session limit]
3. **`/create_handoff`** - Document current state
4. [New session]
5. `/resume_handoff` - Continue where left off

**Phase Completion Handoff**:
1. Complete Phase N
2. `/validate_execution` - Verify work
3. **`/create_handoff`** - Document for next phase
4. [New session]
5. `/resume_handoff` - Start Phase N+1

## Configuration

This command creates rich context documents for work continuity. Best used when work spans multiple sessions or needs transfer between different agents/models.

The handoff document is self-contained and includes everything needed to resume work without loss of context or discovered knowledge.
